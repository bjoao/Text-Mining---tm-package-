An Excellent Dystopian Novel	Just finished 1984 by George Orwell. Truly, this is the best novel in the entire dystopian genre. Orwell eschews the lighthearted writing style of Aldous Huxley for an atmosphere suffused with fear and paranoia. In terms of creativity, 1984 is one of the most refreshing books I've ever read: the ideas of Newspeak and doublethink, the use of the past as a means of controlling the present: all are amazing ideas that should ring true today. Orwell's thoughts on "continuous warfare" should be especially cogent in light of the current "war on terror".The best part of the book is Winston's stay at the Ministry of Love.The only problem with this book is that it puts its ideas before its plot. An example: at a critical juncture in the exposition, when Winston & Julia have started working for the mysterious Brotherhood, Winston sits down and reads a book for about 25-30 pages. The ideas conveyed in the book are fascinating, to be sure, but it brings the narrative to a dead halt.
