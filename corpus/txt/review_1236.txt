Brilliant. Absolutely Brilliant.	Winston Smith knows something is wrong with his world. Smith spends his days re-writing history. He lives in a society where everything, even "facts" are tenuous. His movements, and the movements of his fellow citizens, are monitored by The Party. Big Brother is always watching. Freedom is an antiquated idea that no longer exists. One isn't even free inside one's own head. The Thought Police always find out.George Orwell's famous dystopian novel is an excellent and timely read. People often crack jokes about this novel and our present society, but how far off the mark are those comments? An absolutely engaging and frightening read about a forbidden love affair and a corrupt society, I highly recommend this novel.
