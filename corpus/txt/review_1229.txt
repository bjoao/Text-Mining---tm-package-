One of my favorite books!	This book really bedazzled me when I read it in High School.The media is controlled, the history is rewritten, and the enemies/allies are meant to look like it has always been the same (even though it changes). Anything of a NATURAL human nature is pushed aside, especially love. This is a cold world, that sounds almost purely sci-fi.Unfortunately, some of it is happening now, with the media being controlled by the Pentagon (yes it is really happening now, with this war and all). All in the name of fighting the "other side"- aka terrorists!Anyhow, I keep blabbing, its an awesome book, especially if you read it now, and then wonder what is really happening!
