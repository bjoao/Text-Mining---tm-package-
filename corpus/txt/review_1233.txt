Read Only If You Have Time To Think	You can't always read a book merely because it's a ":classic": and expect it to be ":that good.": Yet 1984 IS ":that good.": The first half of the book is a bit slow and stagnant, yet the end section of this book is absolutely frightening and marvelous. What happens to Julia and Winston is so incredibly sad that I cried. Yes, this is just a book. Yet, when you think in a broader perspective... if you rise above the ":plot": and think of Orwell's message, you can't help but be in awe. Think about it, Orwell's three principles in the book:WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTHHow relevant is that to today?! When you answer that question, you realize WHY this is novel, written in 1949, is a ":future": novel...yet you realize how the eerie future Orwell presents in his novel relates to modern times.A must-read...but don't just read it. It's more important to try to grasp Orwell's message in the book.Marvelous, wonderful, frightening, and more importantly, it makes you think.
